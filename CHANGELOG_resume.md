## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added — Pipeline demo screenshots in the research accordions
- **COVA → "🖼️ Pipeline in Action"**: new 2-slide carousel below the Pipeline Architecture section — generation demo ("Generating 10 bank conversations via Qwen 2.5 14B (8m 50s)") and a sample dialogue ("skeptical victim resists social engineering")
- **COVA-X → "🖼️ Scaling to 10K+"**: new 2-slide carousel — quality scan ("94.1% clean rate, artifact taxonomy breakdown") and the final dataset status ("10,995 conversations across 8 fraud categories")
- **🏗️ Pipeline Architecture** remains a standalone image section (not folded into a carousel)
- Five screenshots added under `Images/cova_workflow/`: `cova_pipeline_architecture.png`, `cova_generation_demo.png`, `cova_sample_dialogue_bank.png`, `cova_quality_scan.png`, `cova_dataset_complete.png`

### Technical
- **New container-scoped carousel** (`moveCarousel(id, dir)` + `.cova-carousel-item`): each research carousel operates only on its own container's slides, so COVA and COVA-X carousels are independent of each other and of the File System project's global `.carousel-item` carousel
- Images constrained to `max-w-2xl`, `loading="lazy"`, dark-mode frames, reduced-motion disables the crossfade, nav buttons are `.no-print`, and the print stylesheet reveals all carousel slides stacked for a complete PDF export

### Notes
- The dataset screenshot shows **10,995** conversations (current live repo, +10 bank conversations generated 2026-07-22); the published benchmark figures elsewhere remain **10,985** (the paper snapshot) — intentionally distinct, so the caption reads "Final dataset" for the live scan
- Removed two unused alternate architecture renders (`cova_pipeline_arc_GROK.jpg`, `cova_pipeline_architecture_Gemini.png`)
- **Version bumped to v2.4.0**

### Preserved
- CSP header (same-origin images need no change), GoatCounter placement, dark mode, print stylesheet, mobile responsiveness, GSAP animations, and `prefers-reduced-motion`

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-22

### Changed — Navy / Gold / Periwinkle color system
- **Site-wide palette overhaul** replacing the previous cyber-blue/purple/indigo scheme with a conservative, academic-research color system organized by a clear hierarchy:
  - **Navy `#1E3A5F`** — structure/authority: header nameplate, all section headings + underlines, structural borders, primary/project buttons, scrollbar, executive-summary left border, print links, and the mobile `theme-color`
  - **Gold `#A16207`** — highlights/achievements: GPA (Executive Summary + Education), and a gold top stripe on each research metric card as an achievement marker
  - **Periwinkle `#818CF8`** — AI/research-specific: research cards (gradient + border), AI/paper badges, arXiv + ScamLingua buttons, research section + timeline headings/dots, and the skills radar chart
- **Implementation**: Tailwind config remaps the built-in `blue`→navy and `purple`/`indigo`→periwinkle families (so existing utility classes recolor automatically) and adds a new `gold` token plus navy/periwinkle scales
- **Metric cards** rewritten to cohesive navy/periwinkle gradients (two cards previously used cyan/teal that fell outside the new system)
- **Radar chart** dataset colors updated to periwinkle

### Notes
- Teal (Labs section, ResearchGate link) and the multi-color tech-tag categories were intentionally left as-is; the recolor targets the core brand surfaces
- **Version bumped to v2.3.0**

### Preserved
- CSP header, GoatCounter placement, dark mode (light/dark variants tuned together), print stylesheet, mobile responsiveness, GSAP animations, and `prefers-reduced-motion` — all unchanged

---

## [2.2.1] - 2026-07-22

### Changed — Executive Summary rewrite (CCI research completed)
- **Executive Summary rewritten** to reflect that the CCI Undergraduate Research Program is now complete: repositioned as an **AI security researcher with two arXiv preprints on synthetic fraud detection** (COVA framework, **under review at IEEE DASC and IEEE BigData 2026**) and a **live dataset platform (ScamLingua.org)**
- Added specificity to the professional background: **high-risk, regulated financial environments (FNMA, FHLMC, FHA, VA)** and a **proven record of managing 3× standard workloads while sustaining 95%+ accuracy**
- **JSON-LD `description`** updated to mirror the new summary for SEO/structured-data consistency
- Research framing kept **internally consistent** with the "Under Review" research cards (arXiv preprints, not "peer-reviewed/published")
- **GPA remains 3.9** (unchanged); **version bumped to v2.2.1**

### Preserved
- CSP header, GoatCounter placement, dark mode, print stylesheet, mobile responsiveness, and `prefers-reduced-motion` — all unchanged (content-only edit)

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added — GSAP Animation Engine
- **GSAP 3.12.5 + ScrollTrigger** loaded from cdnjs (before GoatCounter, synchronous so the plugins are ready when the DOMContentLoaded handler runs)
- **CSP updated**: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com` added to `script-src`; `preconnect` hint added for cdnjs
- **Counters rewritten on GSAP** (`gsap.to` proxy tween, `power2.out` easing) replacing the manual `requestAnimationFrame` loop — smoother easing, plus a one-time guard (`data-counted`) so re-entering the metrics section no longer restarts the count
- **Scroll-reveal rewritten on ScrollTrigger** (`fromTo` per section, `start: 'top 88%'`, `once: true`) replacing the `IntersectionObserver` — more precise, professional reveal timing
- **Graceful fallback**: if GSAP fails to load or `prefers-reduced-motion` is set, JS reveals all sections immediately and snaps counters to final values — nothing breaks with or without the CDN

### Added — Typography (UI/UX design-system recommendation)
- **Crimson Pro** academic serif applied to the nameplate (`header h1`) and section headings (`main section > h2`) to reinforce the research-portfolio identity; Inter retained for all body/UI text. Applied via a single CSS selector (zero HTML changes) — remove the two CSS rules + the Crimson Pro font link to revert. No CSP change needed (same Google Fonts origins)

### Fixed
- **Demo Video placeholder was rendering on the live site.** The block was wrapped in an HTML comment, but its inner "Option 1/2/3" comments contain `-->`, and **HTML comments cannot nest** — so the wrapper closed early and the "Demo Video Coming Soon" box leaked onto the page. Re-wrapped the entire block in an inert `<template id="cova-demo-video">` so nothing renders while **all markup is preserved** for later use (re-enable by removing the two template tags)

### Changed
- **Version bumped to v2.2.0**; visible version string updated in the social links bar

### Preserved (per handoff requirements)
- CSP header maintained and correctly extended for the new cdnjs domain
- GoatCounter analytics kept as the last script before `</body>`
- Dark mode intact on all elements (typography change is font-family only)
- Print stylesheet still forces reveals visible and accordions open (`.reveal` print override beats GSAP inline styles via `!important`)
- Mobile responsiveness (~380px) and `prefers-reduced-motion` respected (dedicated GSAP fallback path)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added — Research Content Expansion (extracted from COVA & COVA-X preprints)
- **"Technical Details" accordion** on the COVA and COVA-X research cards (native `<details>`/`<summary>`, no JS), each covering Tools & Frameworks, Methodology Highlights, Notable Results, and a **"My Contributions"** statement written for interview readiness
- **Research Timeline** section visualizing the COVA → COVA-X → ScamLingua progression (Apr 2026, Jun 2026, 2026)
- **Expanded tech tags** on research cards reflecting the actual stack: Qwen 2.5 14B, Ollama, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, DistilBERT, Longformer, dual-GPU training
- **New "ML Frameworks" skills line**: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Longformer/DistilBERT, TF-IDF
- **COVA-X methodology detail**: three-role virtual-kidnapping architecture (67.1% → 46.5% artifact rate), quality-lifecycle pipeline (contamination scan, stage-direction stripping, automated relabeling), 12.7× label-consistency improvement, documented Qwen 2.5 14B capability limits

### Changed
- **JSON-LD `knowsAbout`** expanded with specific technologies discovered in the papers (Multi-Agent LLM Systems, Prompt Engineering, Longformer, DistilBERT, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, XGBoost, scikit-learn, TF-IDF Text Classification, Conversational AI Classification, Smishing Detection, Social Engineering Defense)
- **AI/ML Research skills line** expanded with concrete framework names and Prompt Engineering
- **Certifications:** `Linux+ (In-Progress)` commented out (study paused) — kept in source as an HTML comment for possible later resumption
- **Version bumped to v2.1.0**; visible version string updated

### Preserved (per handoff requirements)
- Content Security Policy (CSP) — no new external resources required; unchanged
- GoatCounter analytics script placement
- Dark mode across all new elements
- Print stylesheet — accordions force-open and chevrons hidden when printing
- Mobile responsiveness (verified at ~380px) and reduced-motion support
- Scroll-reveal (`reveal` class) on the new Research Timeline section
