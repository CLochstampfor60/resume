## 🚀 Technical Features

This repository is more than a static document; it is a hardened, search-optimized web application designed to demonstrate cybersecurity proficiency in a production environment.

### 🛡️ Security Hardening
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Strict policies implemented via meta tags to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.
- **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Cryptographic verification of external scripts (Tailwind, Chart.js) to ensure code integrity from CDNs.
- **Referrer Policy:** Configured to prevent sensitive data leakage during outbound navigation.
- **Static Architecture:** Hosted on GitHub Pages to leverage a serverless, minimal attack surface.

### 🔍 Search Engine & Knowledge Graph Optimization
- **JSON-LD Structured Data:** Full Schema.org implementation (Person/Credential) for direct integration into Google's Knowledge Graph.
- **Advanced Metadata:** Open Graph and Twitter Card support for professional social sharing previews.
- **Crawl Efficiency:** Custom `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` for optimized search engine indexing.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG-compliant semantic HTML and ARIA labels for mobile-first indexing.

### 💻 Technical Implementation
- **Responsive Dashboard:** Mobile-optimized layout using **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive skill strength analysis powered by **Chart.js**.
- **User Experience:** Dynamic Light/Dark mode toggle with synchronized SOC-style themes.
- **Project Evidence:** Narrative carousels documenting full-lifecycle secure system design.
